# satish-eztraining-python

In the CRT program we are participating, we received training from REIN PREP, which can be found at https://www.reinprep.com/. 
The program is conducted by Pragati Engineering College, available at https://pragati.ac.in/.
During phase one, we covered all the fundamentals of Python through a phase-wise training approach. 
In phase two, we are currently learning about DSA using Python. Each training phase lasts for 6 days.
